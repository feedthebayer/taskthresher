# TaskThresher by Brandon

This is a [breakable toy](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#breakable_toys) created during my [Bloc apprenticeship](http://bloc.io). This is the first rails app that I have created on my own from a list of requirements (compared to following along tutorial style).

This app is live at [taskthresher.bayer.ws](http://taskthresher.bayer.ws)
